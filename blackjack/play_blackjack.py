# You and Python both get two cards for start, You can see only one of Python's cards                  #
# Your goal: Get to 21                                                                                 #
# You can ask 'Hit' and get another card from the deck or 'Stay' to stop the round                     #
# If you got more than 21, its a Bust, and you lose, If Python got more than 21, You win.              #
# If neither of you got 21, the closest one of you is the winner                                       #
# Betting on money is coming soon. You can practice till then                                          #
